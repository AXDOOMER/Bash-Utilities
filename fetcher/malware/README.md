# Malware harvester

## A file fetcher

Old code: [here](https://github.com/AXDOOMER/mal-havest/commits/master)

Purpose: The aim of this program is to take files that contain a list of URLs and extract the URLs from each line in order to download the malware payloads and to save them.

Examples of lists:
* http://vxvault.net/
* https://www.threatweb.com/access/

Note: Script kiddies are worse than AIDS
